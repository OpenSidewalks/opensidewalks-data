    '''Create a MultiDigraph from a GeoDataFrame that has LineString
    geometries using end-to-end connections as nodes and the LineStrings as
    edges. Azimuths are calculated for every edge as the angle of the
    LineString as it exits the node (two edges are created for every row of
    the GeoDataFrame - one in each direction), enabling a circular ordering
    strategy.

    :param linestring_gdf: A GeoDataFrame where the `geometry` column is all
                           LineStrings.

    :param precision: The rounding precision for coordinates to be considered
                      shared (end-to-end). e.g. for lon-lat, 6 or 7 is
                      generally sufficient.

    :param columns: The subset of columns of the GeoDataFrame to embed into the
                    graph edges. If not specified, none are kept (but an
                    appropriately-directed geometry is always embedded). These
                    edge attributes are generated for each edge and will
                    take precedence over specified column values: `geometry`,
                    `forward`, and `azimuth`.

                 swapped for a `reversed` edge.
